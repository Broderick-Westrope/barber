# 3. Cobra CLI

Date: 2023-09-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The context for this decision is the development of this project, a GoLang CLI (Command Line Interface) and TUI (Text-based User Interface) tool for managing code snippets. The project's primary goal is to provide users with efficient snippet management capabilities, whether through commands in the CLI or an interactive TUI.

## Decision

We have decided to adopt the Cobra framework for building the CLI and TUI components of this project. Cobra is a widely-used and well-documented GoLang library for creating powerful and interactive CLI applications. This decision is based on the following considerations.

## Consequences

### Advantages

**Mature and Battle-Tested**: Cobra is a mature framework with a stable API and a strong track record of success in various projects. This maturity reduces the risk of unexpected issues during development.

**Rich Features**: Cobra provides a rich set of features for building CLI applications, including support for commands, flags, argument parsing, and interactive user interfaces. These features align well with the requirements of this project.

**Ease of Use**: Cobra's intuitive and declarative approach to defining CLI commands and flags makes it easy for developers to create complex CLI structures with minimal code. This will help streamline the development of Barber's CLI component.

**Active Community**: Cobra has an active and supportive community, which means we can leverage community-contributed extensions and get assistance if we encounter issues during development.

**Integration with TUI**: Cobra's design allows us to seamlessly integrate it with a TUI library of our choice for the interactive user interface part of the project. This will enable us to maintain a consistent and cohesive user experience.

### Risks

**Learning Curve**: Team members who are not familiar with Cobra may need some time to learn its concepts and best practices. To mitigate this, we will provide training resources and documentation.

**Potential Dependency Issues**: We need to ensure that Cobra and any other libraries we use are well-maintained and compatible with our project's requirements. Regular updates and testing will be crucial.

**TUI Integration Complexity**: While Cobra simplifies the CLI part, integrating it seamlessly with the TUI may require additional effort and expertise. We will allocate sufficient resources and plan the integration carefully.

## Summary

By adopting Cobra for this project's CLI and TUI components, we expect the following:

- Efficient development of both the CLI and TUI components.
- An improved user experience for snippet management.
- Potential community support and contributions to enhance our CLI.
- Risks related to the learning curve, dependency issues, and TUI integration complexity, which will be mitigated through training, careful library selection, and resource allocation.
- Overall, adopting Cobra aligns with our project's goals of delivering a robust and user-friendly snippet management tool with both command-line and interactive capabilities.
